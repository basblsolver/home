However, the general nonconvex form is very challenging and only recently the first deterministic method was proposed by ([Mitsos et al., 2008](http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10898-007-9260-z)).\r\n\r\n### Why BASBL?\r\n\r\n**B**ranch-**A**nd-**S**andwich **B**i**L**evel `BASBL` solver is a [MINOTAUR](https://wiki.mcs.anl.gov/minotaur/index.php/MINOTAUR) solver for nonlinear bilevel problems.\r\n`BASBL` is based on a recent Branch-and-Sandwich algorithm (see [References](https://github.com/basblsolver/manual/wiki/References) section for the theory behind him) which guarantees to solve a broad class of bilevel problems to global optimality. Moreover, `BASBL` is enhanced with several new techniques: reduction of overhead of the UB procedure, alternative ways to calculate tighter bounds, as well as alternative choices for branching and node selection. \r\n\r\n__Important__: `BASBL` solver is still under active design and development and not feature complete or ready for consumption by anyone other than software developers.\r\n\r\n### Test Problems\r\n\r\nDescription of nonconvex bilevel test problems in `AMPL` format, compatible with `BASBL v0.1` is provided on [test-problems-wiki-page](https://github.com/basblsolver/test-problems/wiki).
