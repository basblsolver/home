However, the general nonconvex form is very challenging and only recently the first deterministic method was proposed by ([Mitsos et al., 2008](http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10898-007-9260-z)).\r\n\r\n`BASBL` is based on a recent Branch-and-Sandwich algorithm (see [References](https://github.com/basblsolver/manual/wiki/References) section for the theory behind him) which guarantees to solve a broad class of bilevel problems to global optimality. Moreover, `BASBL` is enhanced with several new techniques: reduction of overhead of the UB procedure, alternative ways to calculate tighter bounds, as well as alternative choices for branching and node selection.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with `BASBL` solver?
