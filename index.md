# Motivation for the solver

Solving _nonlinear_ bilevel problems to global optimality is a long-standing challenge in optimization theory. 
Special cases of bilevel problems, such as problems of _linear_ (_quadratic_) â€“ _linear_ (_quadratic_) type, have been studied extensively and many algorithms have been proposed in the literature ([Dempe, 2002](http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/b101970); [Floudas and Gounaris, 2009](http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10898-008-9332-8)). However, the general nonconvex form is very challenging and only recently the first deterministic method to solve a general class of nonconvex problems to global optimality was proposed by ([Mitsos et al., 2008](http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10898-007-9260-z)). This class includes problems in which the outer and inner problems may contain nonconvex functions, provided that the inner problem does not contain equality constraints. Another algorithm, __Branch-and-Sandwich__, was proposed by [Kleniati and Adjiman (2014a)](http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10898-013-0121-7,[b)](http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10898-013-0120-8) to find the global solution of problems in which the outer and inner problems may contain nonconvex functions and include equality constraints, with the provision that a constraint qualification holds for the inner problem. This restriction was lifted in later work ([Kleniati and Adjiman, 2015](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.compchemeng.2014.06.004)), in which the algorithm was also extended to include binary variables in the outer and inner problems.

# Why BASBL?

**B**ranch-**A**nd-**S**andwich **B**i**L**evel `BASBL` solver is a [MINOTAUR](https://wiki.mcs.anl.gov/minotaur/index.php/MINOTAUR) `C++` solver for nonlinear bilevel problems, based on the [MINOTAUR](https://wiki.mcs.anl.gov/minotaur/index.php/MINOTAUR) framework.
`BASBL` is based on the recent Branch-and-Sandwich algorithm (see [References](#references) section for the underlying theory), which is guaranteed to solve a broad class of bilevel problems to global optimality within epsilon convergence in finite time. Moreover, `BASBL` is enhanced with several new techniques: 

* reduction of overhead of the UB procedure;
* alternative ways to calculate tighter bounds;
* alternative choices for branching and node selection. 

Finally, `BASBL` solver's project is active therefore, more extensions and enhancements will be added soon!

## Command-line interface
`BASBL` is based on command line interface and used over a terminal. The `BASBL` output below is obtained for the bilevel model [mb_1_1_05](https://github.com/basblsolver/test-problems/wiki/mb_1_1_05) using the outer tolerance 1e-3 and the inner tolerance 1e-5.
